# **Battleships Game**
[The Battleships Game](https://loremispum2k8.github.io/battleship/) lets you play the classic naval strategy game directly in your browser.
You and the computer each have a fleet of ships — your goal is to sink all of the opponent’s ships before they sink yours.

## **How It Works**

1. Write the coordonates of your ships on your own grid before the game starts.
You can choose their positions and orientation (horizontal or vertical).

2. Once your fleet is ready, press the 'Done' button.

3. Take turns attacking coordinates on the computer’s grid by clicking on it.

4. The game shows whether your shot was a hit or miss, and marks the grid accordingly.

5. The first to sink all ships wins the game.
