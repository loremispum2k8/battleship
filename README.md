# **The Caesar Cipher**
[The Caesar Cipher website](https://loremispum2k8.github.io/The-Caesar-Cipher/) lets you encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet. You can choose how many positions to shift to create a simple secret code.

## **How It Works**
Each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 3:

```
A → D  
B → E  
C → F

HELLO WORLD → KHOOR ZRUOG
```
To decrypt, the letters are shifted back by the same amount ( _exemple: -3_ ).
There are only 25 possible shifts, so it’s easy to crack today but great for learning how ciphers work.

## **Features**

- Encrypt & decrypt messages
 
- Custom shift value ( _choose how many positions to shift_ )
 
- Simple and intuitive design
 
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
 
- Responsive — works on different screen sizes

## **History**

The Caesar cipher was used by Julius Caesar to send secret military messages.
He reportedly used a shift of three, replacing each letter with the one three places later in the alphabet.
In ancient times, this method worked well because most people couldn’t read, making it surprisingly effective.
