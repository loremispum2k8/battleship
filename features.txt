    Create function that generates random coordonates for 5 ships without colisions of coorodnates that go outside the map indexes 
    Repeat all below for 5 times:

    1. Randomly pick 0-0.5 (row) , 0.5-1 (column)
    2. If 0-0.5 (row) randomly pick 0-10 (number)  -> 1 number 
       If 0.5-1 (column) randomly pick 0-10 (letter)  --> 1 letter
    3. Pick letters or numbers based on the boat length
-->    Pick the first number or the first letter out of the boat length

      Prevent a new boat from hitting another. If at least on coordonate hits another boat then redo the coordonates. Save coordonates history
       After getting the first random letter or number add the rest up or right. If the index goes outside 1 or J add the rest the opposite dirrection down or left from the original random coordonate








    Add system that generates random moves for the computer.
    Update the moves system so that is hits expected coorodnates after getting a hit
    Generate all the moves that the computer will do before after hitting "Done button"



    Make system for giving hits and how they register for me and for the computer
